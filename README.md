# *Source* *C*ache *C*leaner

This project was inspired by [Cache File Cleaner by Ah_Roon](https://gamebanana.com/tools/6688) to expand on the functionality and to practice my C#.

### Features
- Support for multiple Source games
  - TF2 and L4D2 currently available
- No installation required, run the app from anywhere
- Ability to change directories if your installation differs from the norm

### Requirements
- This app requires _.NET Framework 4.5_ or higher.
  - It is highly likely that you already have this installed. If you don't, however, you may get it [here.](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30653)
- It runs on Windows 8.1 and Windows 10.
  - It will likely run on Windows 7 and Windows Vista but I am unable to test them.
